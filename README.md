# ipfs_china_paper_code
Code for the Paper "TODO"

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- R, with `renv` for dependency management, but that should be installed automatically when you open an R session in the `plotting/` directory.
- [Miller](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/), to deal with CSV files on the command line.
    This is probably available in your distribution's repositories
- Docker, to build and run the various pieces of software
- [Our crawler](https://github.com/trudi-group/ipfs-crawler), which we use to crawl the network
- A recent release of [kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo)
- A bunch of (currently three) servers to measure between
- Python 3 for various data wrangling
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to deal with JSON on the command line.
    This is probably available in your distribution's repositories.
